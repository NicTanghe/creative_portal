for now its just a fountain text vieuwer-editor- .
will fix all.

Will also add a little bow
and then i will add markdown and linkin characters.
then i will add dialogue and scene linking so you can export just the dialogue and who a person is talking to.

then ill add the possiblility to click a name or a scene and do wordbuilding in markdown.

also have linking words to their own markdown and the have these linked to words in the screenplay.

then ad a little quick frawing and eracing thing for 
storyboard/colourboard

then add acanvas for reference.

then also add support for 3d moddels.

then also have like a nice set of 3d parralax backgrounds just for the fun of it.

maybe somewhwere in between all that some interfacing with a db and a cdn or whatever
